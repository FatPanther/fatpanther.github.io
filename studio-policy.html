Of course, she is skilled and knowledgeable, but she is also sensitive to children's needs and desire for fun! She is passionate about music and it really shows. My daughter LOVES her teacher. In her words, "I think Monica is a REALLY good teacher. I think I am really lucky. I don't think everyone has a teacher like Monica." - Renee Takara</p><p>Two of my children have been taking lessons from Monica for years. She demonstrates incredible professionalism and a personal love of both piano and teaching. She has been attentive to the individual needs and musical interests of my boys. She adapts the lessons to bring out the strengths they possess while challenging them to take risks and grow. She has also developed them as emerging performers. The recitals are well crafted and thoroughly enjoyable. The studio is professional and well-equipped for learning. Overall, simply outstanding. I would enthusiastically recommend! - Sabrina Sommer</p><figure class="post__image--center"><img class="lazyload" loading="lazy" src="https://sanderspianostudio.com/media/posts/2/responsive/IMG_20200120_094226-xs.jpg" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="https://sanderspianostudio.com/media/posts/2/responsive/IMG_20200120_094226-xs.jpg 300w ,https://sanderspianostudio.com/media/posts/2/responsive/IMG_20200120_094226-sm.jpg 480w ,https://sanderspianostudio.com/media/posts/2/responsive/IMG_20200120_094226-md.jpg 768w ,https://sanderspianostudio.com/media/posts/2/responsive/IMG_20200120_094226-lg.jpg 1024w" width="3968" height="2976"></figure><p>Our son has been taking lessons from Monica for the past three years, going on four. Monica is dedicated, engaging, invested in each one of her students and most of all makes music fun. We couldn’t have asked for a better piano teacher. We love and appreciate her! - Peter Perrin</p><p>Monica Sanders has been our children’s piano teacher for several years. She provides quality instruction with a caring approach. Monica’s recitals grow every year. She has brought professional musicians to add to the instrumentation and offer students a rich opportunity to perform in live band situations. We recommend Sanders studio to anyone who desires a multidimensional musical journey. - Sierra Nelson-Nord</p><figure class="post__image--center"><img class="lazyload" loading="lazy" src="https://sanderspianostudio.com/media/posts/2/responsive/IMG_20200120_094208-xs.jpg" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="https://sanderspianostudio.com/media/posts/2/responsive/IMG_20200120_094208-xs.jpg 300w ,https://sanderspianostudio.com/media/posts/2/responsive/IMG_20200120_094208-sm.jpg 480w ,https://sanderspianostudio.com/media/posts/2/responsive/IMG_20200120_094208-md.jpg 768w ,https://sanderspianostudio.com/media/posts/2/responsive/IMG_20200120_094208-lg.jpg 1024w" alt="" width="3968" height="2976"></figure><p>Monica has been the best teacher I've ever had. Not only is she excellent at helping with the fundamentals of reading music, building technique, and understanding the music theory behind the pieces, but she also excels in helping to unlock what gives music character, giving the student the ability to understand the emotions within a given piece and to express them in an authentic fashion. - Thomas DeNicola</p><p>Monica is a wonderful piano teacher.  She’s warm, professional, encouraging and incredibly knowledgeable.  Each week I look forward to my lessons with her because I’m consistently amazed at how much I can learn in just one hour.  Leaving Monica’s studio, I’m always inspired to immediately go work on what we went over.  I really appreciate that she takes the time to focus not only on repertoire, but warm ups, technique, theory, sight reading, and understanding how the body is structured/moves to play more comfortably and efficiently.  I highly recommend her as a piano teacher to people of all ages and skill levels. - Aliza Pilusuk</p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p><a href="mailto:monica@sanderspianostudio.com">monica@sanderspianostudio.com</a> | 503-703-5533</p><p>Sanders Piano Studio is located in the Woodstock neighborhood of Southeast Portland.</p></div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js" integrity="sha256-k2WSCIexGzOj3Euiig+TlR8gA0EmPjuc79OEeY5L45g=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script defer="defer" src="https://sanderspianostudio.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=8e2c228bbd05676f9f2a50a58e9b6636"></script></body></html>
