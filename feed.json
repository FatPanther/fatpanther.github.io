I love what I do and I love how the process of learning and creating music never gets old. I am constantly inspired by my students and I aim to inspire them to become life long learners of music. </p>\n<p>As a younger sibling, I watched my older brother play piano and I wanted to do it too from the moment the piano came into our home. I was thrilled when the day finally came that I too got to take piano lessons. This was one of the greatest gifts my parents could have given me. My childhood teacher, Deborah Mele, is an inspiration to this day and I am so grateful for everything I learned from her. She gave me an incredible foundation to take with me into my career as a musician and music educator. Along the way I have also been lucky to study with many inspiring teachers, all of whom contribute to what I am able to offer my students in their lessons. My love of music guided me through to receiving my MA in Music from Portland State University where I also became a Licensed Body Mapping Educator. This method gave me the chance to finally have the language to bring together my love of movement, sports and dance and my music making. Making music is a movement art. Movement is life! </p>\n<p>I have been teaching and performing in Oregon for the past 18 years. I currently teach private piano lessons (due to COVID - 19 mostly online, but some in person as well - you choose what works for you, some students choose a combination), group classes, summer camps and body mapping sessions and workshops in my studio in Southeast Portland.</p>\n<p>As a licensed Body Mapping Educator I offer the course What Every Musician Needs to Know About the Body. Please ask me about it if you are interested in learning more about this incredible method to enhance your musicianship and quality of life. I also work with musicians to help them recover from injury, to prevent injury and to uncover greater ease in playing.</p>\n<p>I continue to have a rich and joyful career in performing, composing and teaching both classical and jazz piano. I am currently doing a video project - 100 days of free improvisation - to encourage exploration of color, sound, movement and authenticity at the piano, free of judgement. In addition to music, I enjoy spending time with my family, hiking, cooking, reading, writing, sewing and training my two dogs. My first degree is a BA in Romance Languages. I speak Italian, Spanish and some German, and have traveled and worked abroad extensively in Europe and Latin America. Please contact me to set up a time to meet so we can chat about how I can  help foster and guide your child’s creative, musical spirit.</p>\n<p>Please enjoy this video I recorded in September of 2022 of Debussy's Arabesque No. 1.</p>\n<p><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/whKw0xVQlA0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Melodiously,</p>\n<p>Monica</p>\n<p> </p>",

Through Body Mapping, musicians experience an enhanced ability to express themselves at their instruments with ease. </p>\n<h3><figure class=\"post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://sanderspianostudio.com/media/posts/4/goodspinesittingpic2.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://sanderspianostudio.com/media/posts/4/responsive/goodspinesittingpic2-xs.jpg 300w ,https://sanderspianostudio.com/media/posts/4/responsive/goodspinesittingpic2-sm.jpg 480w ,https://sanderspianostudio.com/media/posts/4/responsive/goodspinesittingpic2-md.jpg 768w ,https://sanderspianostudio.com/media/posts/4/responsive/goodspinesittingpic2-lg.jpg 1024w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1367\"></figure></h3>\n<h3><strong>What is the Body Map?</strong></h3>\n<p>The body map is a literal map (neuronal representation) in our brains of how our bodies are put together. This map dictates how we move. The body map can change over time based on experience, knowledge and awareness. It is not something that is \"fixed\", but rather it can grow and change throughout a lifetime. When the body map is accurate, representing the true design of the body, then the movement it produces will be free, easy, balanced and coordinated. When the body map is innacurate, movement will likely be uncomfortable, labor intensive or forced and may eventually lead to injury. Since musicians move their bodies to produce sound, it is absolutely necessary that they include the study of movement according to the anatomical truth governed by an accurate body map.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://sanderspianostudio.com/media/posts/4/bmwholearm.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://sanderspianostudio.com/media/posts/4/responsive/bmwholearm-xs.jpg 300w ,https://sanderspianostudio.com/media/posts/4/responsive/bmwholearm-sm.jpg 480w ,https://sanderspianostudio.com/media/posts/4/responsive/bmwholearm-md.jpg 768w ,https://sanderspianostudio.com/media/posts/4/responsive/bmwholearm-lg.jpg 1024w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1367\"></figure>\n<h3>Private lessons:</h3>\n<p>I am available for private lessons working with injured musicians who are working to retrain their movement. Body Mapping enhances and informs many other movement approaches such as the Taubman Technique and the Alexander Technique. Body Mapping puts musicians on a secure somatic foundation. Musicians who work with this movement modality come away knowing that their job is to move their bodies with the highest quality of movement in order to create a variety of sounds at their instrument. Body Mapping develops a musician's ability to observe their own quality of movement and to make adjustments as needed in order to move with the greatest of ease and to create the highest quality of music.</p>\n<h3>Workshops/lecture-demonstrations:</h3>\n<p><strong>\"What Every Musician Needs to Know About the Body\"</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\"Movement Foundations for Music Educators\"</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\"Awareness and Movement matter: Finding the lesson time to inspire children to cultivate inclusive awareness and move well at and away from the piano.\"</strong></p>\n<p>All workshops are available online currently to fit the needs of your group. All educators, athletes, instrumentalists and vocalists are welcome to attend. </p>\n<p>Workshops geared toward non-musicians and athletes looking to enhance their quality of movement are also available. This modality simply leads to greater ease in movement and enhanced joy in experiencing the myriad of movement one makes in daily life. Healthier ways of approaching tasks such as typing at a keyboard, bringing more variety of movement into the office and home setting can result from the incorporation of Body Mapping into one's pursuit of physical well-being.</p>\n<p>Please contact me if you are interested in scheduling a workshop for your organization or group!</p>",

We recommend Sanders studio to anyone who desires a multidimensional musical journey. - Sierra Nelson-Nord</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://sanderspianostudio.com/media/posts/2/IMG_20200120_094208.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://sanderspianostudio.com/media/posts/2/responsive/IMG_20200120_094208-xs.jpg 300w ,https://sanderspianostudio.com/media/posts/2/responsive/IMG_20200120_094208-sm.jpg 480w ,https://sanderspianostudio.com/media/posts/2/responsive/IMG_20200120_094208-md.jpg 768w ,https://sanderspianostudio.com/media/posts/2/responsive/IMG_20200120_094208-lg.jpg 1024w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"3968\" height=\"2976\"></figure>\n<p>Monica has been the best teacher I've ever had. Not only is she excellent at helping with the fundamentals of reading music, building technique, and understanding the music theory behind the pieces, but she also excels in helping to unlock what gives music character, giving the student the ability to understand the emotions within a given piece and to express them in an authentic fashion. - Thomas DeNicola</p>\n<p>Monica is a wonderful piano teacher.  She’s warm, professional, encouraging and incredibly knowledgeable.  Each week I look forward to my lessons with her because I’m consistently amazed at how much I can learn in just one hour.  Leaving Monica’s studio, I’m always inspired to immediately go work on what we went over.  I really appreciate that she takes the time to focus not only on repertoire, but warm ups, technique, theory, sight reading, and understanding how the body is structured/moves to play more comfortably and efficiently.  I highly recommend her as a piano teacher to people of all ages and skill levels. - Aliza Pilusuk</p>",
